***plays My House by Flo Rida***  

Hello,  

So Apple requires developers to have a website to publish apps, so here she is. This website was mainly meant to be a place to host landing pages for the apps I'm working on, but I'm thinking it may be helpful to share things like progress updates and the reasoning that goes behind a product decision. I'm also thinking of sharing things that may be generally useful to other people, outside the context of the products I'm working on, such as polished versions of the random notes I have lying around that are worth sharing. 

Right now I'm working on an app to help people be more intentional with the time they spend on social media, so hoping to publish that soon and maybe share why the app does what it does.
